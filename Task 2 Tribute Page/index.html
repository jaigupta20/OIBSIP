            Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela (1918-2013) was a South African
            anti-apartheid revolutionary, political leader, and philanthropist
            who served as the President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999. He
            was the country's first black head of state and the first elected in
            a fully representative democratic election. He fought against
            institutionalized racism and inequality and dedicated his life to
            promoting peace, justice, and human rights.

      <h2>Early Life</h2>
      <p>
        Nelson Mandela was born in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa on
        July 18, 1918. His father was a local chief and he was the youngest of
        four children. He attended a Methodist school and later went to the
        University of Fort Hare, where he studied law. He became involved in
        politics and joined the African National Congress (ANC), a political
        organization that fought against apartheid, in 1944.
      </p>
      <h2>Imprisonment</h2>
      <p>
        In 1962, Mandela was arrested and charged with sabotage and conspiracy
        to overthrow the government. He was sentenced to life imprisonment and
        spent the next 27 years in jail, mostly on Robben Island. Despite being
        in prison, he continued to be a symbol of hope and inspiration for the
        anti-apartheid movement.
      </p>
      <h2>Release and Presidency</h2>
      <p>
        Mandela was released from prison on February 11, 1990, after
        international pressure forced the South African government to negotiate
        his release. He became the President of the ANC in 1991 and was elected
        President of South Africa in 1994, serving one term in office. During
        his presidency, he focused on reconciling the country and promoting
        racial harmony.
      </p>
      <h2>Legacy</h2>
      <p>
        Nelson Mandela is widely regarded as one of the greatest leaders of the
        20th century. He received numerous honors and awards, including the
        Nobel Peace Prize in 1993, for his efforts to end apartheid and promote
        democracy and human rights. His legacy continues to inspire people
        around the world to fight for social justice and equality. He once said,
        "For to be free is not merely to cast off one's chains, but to live in a
        way that respects and enhances the freedom of others."
